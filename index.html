                            At Creditas, I'm part of the communications team, responsible to develop and maintain a platform to help other teams reach our customers through phone calls, e-mails, text and WhatsApp messages.
                            <br />To make this possible, we integrate with third-party solutions and create RESTful APIs for other teams at Creditas to consume.
                            <br />Some of the technologies used to deliver this experience are Python (+ Flask), Kotlin (+ Spring Boot) and PostgreSQL.

                            <br />The technologies used to achieve these results included Java and Kotlin (+Spring), MySQL and Redis.

                        <p>
                            Mineplex creates proprietary third-party gaming software and server development for Minecraft. I was part of the team who helped to maintain and create in-game visual effects and utilities.
                            <br />I was also part of the team responsible for developing a monthly subscription service that rewards subscribed players with a unique item every month.
                            <br />To achieve this, the team used Java (+Bukkit Framework) and MySQL.

                            Hypixel is the largest Minecraft server, and creator of the <a href="https://hypixelstudios.com/">Hypixel Studios</a>, a game studio acquired by Riot in April 2020.
                            <br />At Hypixel, I worked in a team responsible for the development and launching of mini-games, such as UHC Champions.
                            <br />Java (+Bukkit Framework) and MongoDB were used to develop these mini-games.

                            Faker Ruby is a port of the Perl's Data::Faker library, which generates fake data to be used in tests.
                            It can be used to generate real-looking random data to create fake entries in databases and test mocks.
                            My contributions include translation of strings to Portuguese, adding new generators and fixing some bugs.
